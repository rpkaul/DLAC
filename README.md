# Deep Learning Anti-Cheat For CSGO
# Use Python Version 3.9.11


Input the directory with your .dem files and the model outputs predictions for every shot during the game.

```python
from DLAC import Model

model = Model("C:\\path\\to\\demo\\directory\\")
model.predict_to_terminal(threshold=0.90)
```

```python
from DLAC import Model

model = Model("C:\\path\\to\\demo\\directory\\")
model.predict_to_csv(threshold=0.90, out_file'example.csv')
```

## Installation
Windows should be as easy as:
```python
pip install DLAC
```
Linux users will need to build the .so file. This requres GO.
```
git clone https://github.com/LaihoE/DLAC  
cd DLAC
python3 setup.py install
cd DLAC
go build -o parser.so -buildmode=c-shared
```

## You can choose between a bigger and a smaller model
```python
from DLAC import Model

model = Model("./path_to_demos/", model_type='big')
model.predict_to_terminal(threshold=0.99)   # 0.99 is recommended with the bigger model
```
The bigger model is slower with slightly better accuracy  


Other ways to output predictions  
model.predict_to_csv()  
model.predict_to_list()

## Example output from one shot  
```CSV
Name, Confidence of cheating, SteamId, File
PeskyCheater22, 0.9601634, 123456789, exampledemo.dem
```
